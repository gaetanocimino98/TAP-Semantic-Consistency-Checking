By reading this field, a new user can more easily understand what an applet is for and decide whether or not to activate it on their device. However, on the part of IFTTT, there is no control over\n","the content of the description entered by the user, so the creator could write anything, falsely describing the applet’s behavior. To this end, we developed a model that can check whether there is some semantic consistency between the trigger-action components of an applet and its natural language description provided by its creator. We fine-tuned a GPT2-based classification model that takes as input a pattern derived from the applet components and the corresponding user-defined description and outputs a classification label ('cc', 'ce', 'ec' or 'ee').\n","\n","### References\n","\n","* [\"An empirical characterization of IFTTT: ecosystem, usage, and performance\"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3131365.3131369)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Install transformers library.\n","!pip install -q git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n","# Install helper functions.\n","!pip install -q git+https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things.git"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import seaborn as sn\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import io\n","import os\n","import torch\n","from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\n","from ml_things import plot_dict, plot_confusion_matrix, fix_text\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\n","from transformers import (set_seed,\n","                          TrainingArguments,\n","                          Trainer,\n","                          GPT2Config,\n","                          GPT2Tokenizer,\n","                          AdamW,\n","                          get_linear_schedule_with_warmup,\n","                          GPT2ForSequenceClassification)\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import precision_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import recall_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import f1_score"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":478},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":54,"status":"ok","timestamp":1690271685473,"user":{"displayName":"GAETANO CIMINO","userId":"15514720190860715047"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"bGvpnuXzG4Pq","outputId":"8c807614-038f-49a7-a51c-6c6c14c4326d"},"outputs":[],"source":["train_path = 'trainSet.csv'\n","\n","col_names = ['label','pattern','desc']\n","train_df = pd.read_csv(train_path,skiprows=1,sep=';',names=col_names,encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","\n","train_df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":478},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":43,"status":"ok","timestamp":1690271685474,"user":{"displayName":"GAETANO CIMINO","userId":"15514720190860715047"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"G2cXoLSpHnx-","outputId":"07f5031e-56fd-4cf9-d4cf-8b6ea6edf696"},"outputs":[],"source":["val_path = 'devSet.csv'\n","\n","valid_df = pd.read_csv(val_path,skiprows=1,sep=';',names=col_names,encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","\n","valid_df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":478},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":37,"status":"ok","timestamp":1690271685475,"user":{"displayName":"GAETANO CIMINO","userId":"15514720190860715047"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"RNfTve2NITiC","outputId":"03b58f15-3537-4fb6-8131-2ca6384d911d"},"outputs":[],"source":["test_path = 'testSet.csv'\n","\n","test_df = pd.read_csv(test_path,skiprows=1,sep=';',names=col_names,encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\")\n","\n","test_df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":25,"status":"ok","timestamp":1690271735217,"user":{"displayName":"GAETANO CIMINO","userId":"15514720190860715047"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"XSfCXc3JsueE","outputId":"13e912b5-1b5c-4a5a-f2f1-e145b40d3221"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Set seed for reproducibility.\n","set_seed(123)\n","\n","# Number of training epochs (authors on fine-tuning Bert recommend between 2 and 4).\n","epochs = 5\n","\n","# Number of batches - depending on the max sequence length and GPU memory.\n","# For 512 sequence length batch of 10 works without cuda memory issues.\n","# For small sequence length can try batch of 32 or higher.\n","batch_size = 32\n","\n","# Pad or truncate text sequences to a specific length\n","# if `None` it will use maximum sequence of word piece tokens allowed by model.\n","max_length = 60\n","\n","# Look for gpu to use.
